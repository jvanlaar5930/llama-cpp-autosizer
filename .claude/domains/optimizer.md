# Domain: Optimizer (iterative benchmark/tune loop)

## Purpose

Core feature of the app: automatically finds the best `llama-server` settings for a given GGUF model by repeatedly benchmarking and adjusting one parameter at a time until scores converge.

## Key Files

- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/OptimizerService.cs` — the loop itself. `OptimizeAsync(...)` returns `IAsyncEnumerable<OptimizationIteration>` so the TUI can render progress live. Caller supplies the `OptimizationSession` object (avoids duplicating history state).
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/RecommendationService.cs` — decides the next parameter to change. Recommendation chain: **cloud advisor (Claude CLI, optional) → local LLM → heuristic** (`ExplorationOrder`). Each step falls through on failure or when the suggestion recreates an already-tested config.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/CloudAdvisorService.cs` — optional frontier-model recommender: shells out to the Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`, prompt via stdin, `--model` from settings). Configured via `AppSettings.CloudAdvisorCommand`/`CloudAdvisorModel` (Settings → Cloud Advisor); disabled when the command is empty. Availability (`--version` probe) is cached per command. Sources tagged `claude`/`claude-push` in iteration history. Calls use `--output-format json`; per-call and per-run token/cost usage is parsed from the envelope and reported through the activity log (run totals reset when `SetActivityLog` gets a non-null handler).
- Recommender activity is user-visible via `RecommendationService.SetActivityLog(Action<string>?)` (which also wires `CloudAdvisorService`): every ask/answer/fallback along the Claude → local LLM → heuristic chain. `MainMenu` pipes it into the optimization run's rolling log panel prefixed `[advisor]` (rendered cyan). ILogger alone is invisible in the TUI (min level Warning) — new recommender events must go through `LogActivity`, not just `logger`.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/BenchmarkService.cs` — runs the actual timed prompts (warmup + benchmark + optional tool/agent-loop/accuracy/stress-test cases) against the running server and produces a `BenchmarkResult`.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Models/OptimizationProfile.cs` — defines `Chat` and `Agentic` built-in profiles: benchmark prompts, tool definitions, accuracy prompts, agent-loop cases, and `ScoringWeights`. `ScoreResult(BenchmarkResult)` computes the composite score the optimizer maximizes.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Models/LlamaSettings.cs` — the tunable parameter set. `ToServerArgs()` converts to CLI args, `Fingerprint()` gives a canonical identity string used to detect and skip duplicate configurations, `Clone()` for per-iteration mutation.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Models/OptimizationSession.cs` — `ParameterChange`, `OptimizationIteration`, `OptimizationSession` — the history/result records persisted at the end of a run.

## Main Flows

1. **Baseline** — `HardwareDetectionService.DetectAsync()` runs, `LlamaServerService` starts the server with initial settings (derived from hardware + model file size), `BenchmarkService.RunAsync()` produces the baseline `BenchmarkResult`, scored via `profile.ScoreResult()`.
   - Note: the server may self-heal an unsupported initial setting (e.g. quantized KV cache without flash attention). The optimizer must use `server.LastEffectiveSettings` (not the requested `initialSettings`) as the true baseline going forward.
2. **Recommend** — `RecommendationService.GetNextRecommendationAsync(session, profile, hardware, ct)`:
   - If the server is running and at least 1 iteration has completed, asks the model itself for the next `ParameterChange` as JSON.
   - Rejects LLM suggestions that reproduce an already-tested config (`RecreatesTestedConfig`, uses `LlamaSettings.Fingerprint()`), falling back to heuristic in that case.
   - Heuristic fallback walks `ExplorationOrder`: `GpuLayers, FlashAttention, CacheTypeK, CacheTypeV, BatchSize, UBatchSize, ContextSize, Threads, Mlock`.
3. **Apply and re-benchmark** — settings cloned + mutated with the one parameter change, server restarted (self-healing retry if the new setting fails to start), benchmarked again, scored.
4. **Hardware-insufficiency rescue** — when the fastest TG measured by any iteration is below `TargetTgSpeed × RescueThresholdFraction` (0.25), normal recommendation is bypassed for `RecommendationService.GetRescueAsync` (Claude → local LLM → `GetDrasticHeuristicRescue` static combo of up to 3 drastic moves: experts→2, ctx→2048, KV→q4_0, full offload, thinking off). Capped at `MaxRescueAttempts` (2) benchmarked attempts; after that — or when the rescue chain returns null (drastic floor reached / recommenders answer DONE) — the run ends with a "Hardware insufficient for this model" CompletionReason telling the user to pick a smaller model/quant or lower target. Rescue sources: `claude-rescue`/`llm-rescue`/`heuristic-rescue` (UI tags `Claude⚑`/`LLM⚑`/`Rescue`).
5. **Convergence check** — stops when score improvement drops below `OptimizationOptions.ConvergenceThreshold` (default 0.01) for `ConvergencePatience` consecutive rounds (default 3), or `MaxIterations` is hit (default 20). Capability gains (context/experts) and quality-metric gains (QualityScore/ToolSuccessRate/AgentLoopScore, ≥ 0.05) also reset the patience counter; duplicate-config skips do not consume patience. When the final-push LLM says DONE, the loop only ends if the heuristic pool is also exhausted. `VerifyBestAtEnd` (default true) re-runs the best config once more before finalizing (Agentic verification always includes the repetition stress test).
6. **Persist (crash-safe)** — `SessionPersistenceService` writes the `OptimizationSession` to `sessions/<model>_<profile>_<timestamp>.json` **after every iteration** (baseline, each benchmarked/skipped/failed iteration, verification, and on completion), so a crash or freeze mid-run loses at most the in-flight iteration. In parallel, `OptimizerService` upserts a per-model **auto-best profile** (`AutoBestProfileName` → `"Auto-best: <model> (<profile>)"`, stable GUID reused across runs) via `ProfileLibraryService` whenever `session.Best` changes — a pre-existing auto-best from an earlier run is only overwritten once the current run matches its settings or beats its stored score.
7. **Prior-run reuse** — at run setup, `MainMenu` loads earlier sessions of the same model + profile (`SessionPersistenceService.LoadPriorSessionsAsync`, matched by model file name; incomplete/crashed sessions included) and offers: (a) start from the best settings found across those runs, and (b) seed `OptimizationSession.PriorIterations` with every previously benchmarked iteration. Seeded priors extend the duplicate guard (`HasTestedConfiguration`) and the recommenders' `AlreadyTriedValue`/`NextContextStep` checks, and both LLM prompts list the prior param=value pairs — so no configuration is ever re-benchmarked across runs. `PriorIterations` is `[JsonIgnore]`: it must never be serialized (session files would snowball) and never feeds `Best` or the UI.

## Data and State

- In-memory: `OptimizationSession` accumulates `OptimizationIteration` entries as the loop runs; the same object is used by the UI for live display and by persistence at the end (no duplication).
- On disk: `sessions/*.json` (full history), optionally `profiles/*.json` if the user saves the winning config as a named profile afterward (`ProfileLibraryService`, separate from the optimizer itself).

## External Systems

- `llama-server` subprocess (via `LlamaServerService`) — started/stopped once per iteration.
- The model being tuned is also used as the recommender (self-referential: the model under test suggests its own next tuning step via chat completion).

## Tests and Validation

Needs verification — no automated tests exist for the optimizer loop. Validate by running a full optimization (`dotnet run --project src/LlamaCppAutosizer`, menu option 5) against a real model and checking the resulting `sessions/*.json` and printed summary/command.

## Quality-Tuning Phase

Once the best config's TG rate clears `TargetTgSpeed × 1.1` (buffer avoids phase-flipping on noise), the heuristic recommender switches to quality tuning, in order: revert aggressive KV-cache quant (q4/q5 → q8_0; q8_0 → f16 only with ≥ 15 t/s headroom), escalate anti-loop samplers (DRY → 1.05, then repeat-penalty → 1.15) when quality/agent-loop scores show loop symptoms, enable thinking mode (Agentic + thinking-capable models), restore MoE experts, then grow context. Both LLM prompts describe the same phase. The Agentic profile auto-runs the repetition stress test each iteration once the TG target is met, and `BenchmarkService` folds a graded distinct-trigram "repetition health" factor into QualityScore so near-loops are visible before the binary loop detector fires.

## Known Gotchas

- Always read `LlamaServerService.LastEffectiveSettings` after a start attempt rather than assuming the requested `LlamaSettings` took effect — self-healing retries silently revert unsupported values.
- Adding a new tunable parameter requires three coordinated edits: `LlamaSettings` (property + `ToServerArgs`/`Fingerprint`/`Summary`), `RecommendationService.ExplorationOrder` (heuristic order), and wherever the LLM-recommendation JSON schema/prompt enumerates valid parameter names — missing one causes the optimizer to silently never explore the new parameter via one of the two recommendation paths.
- `OptimizationProfile.ScoreResult()` weights differ significantly between Chat and Agentic — a change to scoring normalization (`NormalizeRate`/`NormalizeTtft` bounds) affects both profiles; check both when tuning scoring behavior. `NormalizeRate` is log-scale (TG 5–300, PP 50–10000) specifically so fast hardware doesn't saturate every config to 1.0 and fake "no improvement" convergence.
- `TimeToFirstTokenMs` is the **server-reported prompt-eval time** (`timings.prompt_ms`), not wall clock — the wall-clock tuple from `CompleteAsync` covers the entire non-streaming response and must not be used as TTFT (it double-counts generation speed).
- The MoE expert-count override must use the arch-prefixed GGUF key: `--override-kv {arch}.expert_used_count=int:N`, with `{arch}` read via `GgufMetadata.GetArchitecture()` (e.g. `qwen3moe`). Wrong/unprefixed keys are silently ignored by llama-server — verify in the startup log (`n_expert_used = N`).
- Thinking mode cannot be toggled via `--override-kv` (it's a chat-template variable, not GGUF metadata). Use `--chat-template-kwargs {"enable_thinking":...}` and, when disabling, also `--reasoning-budget 0`.
- `ParameterChange.OldValue/NewValue` are typed `object?` — anything flowing out of a *deserialized* session (e.g. seeded `PriorIterations`) only carries native int/long/double/bool/string because `SessionPersistenceService`'s `ObjectPrimitiveConverter` rehydrates them. Without it they'd be `JsonElement`, which crashes `Convert.ToInt32` consumers (`NextContextStep`, MoE escalation). If another serializer ever loads sessions, it needs the same treatment; and box ternary branches explicitly or C# promotes mixed int/long/double arms all to double.
- `GetHeuristicRecommendation` retries past candidates that recreate already-tested configs by blocking the parameter and asking `GetHeuristicCandidate` again (bounded loop). Every candidate branch must respect both the name-level `tried` set **and** the `Blocked(param)` check for value-gated branches — a branch missing the `Blocked` check gets re-proposed forever on retry and falsely exhausts the pool.
