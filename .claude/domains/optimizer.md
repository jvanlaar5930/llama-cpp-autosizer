# Domain: Optimizer (iterative benchmark/tune loop)

## Purpose

Core feature of the app: automatically finds the best `llama-server` settings for a given GGUF model by repeatedly benchmarking and adjusting one parameter at a time until scores converge.

## Key Files

- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/OptimizerService.cs` — the loop itself. `OptimizeAsync(...)` returns `IAsyncEnumerable<OptimizationIteration>` so the TUI can render progress live. Caller supplies the `OptimizationSession` object (avoids duplicating history state).
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/RecommendationService.cs` — decides the next parameter to change. Tries the LLM first (via `LlamaServerService`, `/v1/chat/completions`, JSON response), falls back to a fixed heuristic order (`ExplorationOrder`) on failure or if the LLM suggests a config that's already been tested.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Services/BenchmarkService.cs` — runs the actual timed prompts (warmup + benchmark + optional tool/agent-loop/accuracy/stress-test cases) against the running server and produces a `BenchmarkResult`.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Models/OptimizationProfile.cs` — defines `Chat` and `Agentic` built-in profiles: benchmark prompts, tool definitions, accuracy prompts, agent-loop cases, and `ScoringWeights`. `ScoreResult(BenchmarkResult)` computes the composite score the optimizer maximizes.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Models/LlamaSettings.cs` — the tunable parameter set. `ToServerArgs()` converts to CLI args, `Fingerprint()` gives a canonical identity string used to detect and skip duplicate configurations, `Clone()` for per-iteration mutation.
- `src/LlamaCppAutosizer/Models/OptimizationSession.cs` — `ParameterChange`, `OptimizationIteration`, `OptimizationSession` — the history/result records persisted at the end of a run.

## Main Flows

1. **Baseline** — `HardwareDetectionService.DetectAsync()` runs, `LlamaServerService` starts the server with initial settings (derived from hardware + model file size), `BenchmarkService.RunAsync()` produces the baseline `BenchmarkResult`, scored via `profile.ScoreResult()`.
   - Note: the server may self-heal an unsupported initial setting (e.g. quantized KV cache without flash attention). The optimizer must use `server.LastEffectiveSettings` (not the requested `initialSettings`) as the true baseline going forward.
2. **Recommend** — `RecommendationService.GetNextRecommendationAsync(session, profile, hardware, ct)`:
   - If the server is running and at least 1 iteration has completed, asks the model itself for the next `ParameterChange` as JSON.
   - Rejects LLM suggestions that reproduce an already-tested config (`RecreatesTestedConfig`, uses `LlamaSettings.Fingerprint()`), falling back to heuristic in that case.
   - Heuristic fallback walks `ExplorationOrder`: `GpuLayers, FlashAttention, CacheTypeK, CacheTypeV, BatchSize, UBatchSize, ContextSize, Threads, Mlock`.
3. **Apply and re-benchmark** — settings cloned + mutated with the one parameter change, server restarted (self-healing retry if the new setting fails to start), benchmarked again, scored.
4. **Convergence check** — stops when score improvement drops below `OptimizationOptions.ConvergenceThreshold` (default 0.01) for `ConvergencePatience` consecutive rounds (default 3), or `MaxIterations` is hit (default 20). Capability gains (context/experts) and quality-metric gains (QualityScore/ToolSuccessRate/AgentLoopScore, ≥ 0.05) also reset the patience counter; duplicate-config skips do not consume patience. When the final-push LLM says DONE, the loop only ends if the heuristic pool is also exhausted. `VerifyBestAtEnd` (default true) re-runs the best config once more before finalizing (Agentic verification always includes the repetition stress test).
5. **Persist** — `SessionPersistenceService` writes the completed `OptimizationSession` to `sessions/<model>_<profile>_<timestamp>.json`.

## Data and State

- In-memory: `OptimizationSession` accumulates `OptimizationIteration` entries as the loop runs; the same object is used by the UI for live display and by persistence at the end (no duplication).
- On disk: `sessions/*.json` (full history), optionally `profiles/*.json` if the user saves the winning config as a named profile afterward (`ProfileLibraryService`, separate from the optimizer itself).

## External Systems

- `llama-server` subprocess (via `LlamaServerService`) — started/stopped once per iteration.
- The model being tuned is also used as the recommender (self-referential: the model under test suggests its own next tuning step via chat completion).

## Tests and Validation

Needs verification — no automated tests exist for the optimizer loop. Validate by running a full optimization (`dotnet run --project src/LlamaCppAutosizer`, menu option 5) against a real model and checking the resulting `sessions/*.json` and printed summary/command.

## Quality-Tuning Phase

Once the best config's TG rate clears `TargetTgSpeed × 1.1` (buffer avoids phase-flipping on noise), the heuristic recommender switches to quality tuning, in order: revert aggressive KV-cache quant (q4/q5 → q8_0; q8_0 → f16 only with ≥ 15 t/s headroom), escalate anti-loop samplers (DRY → 1.05, then repeat-penalty → 1.15) when quality/agent-loop scores show loop symptoms, enable thinking mode (Agentic + thinking-capable models), restore MoE experts, then grow context. Both LLM prompts describe the same phase. The Agentic profile auto-runs the repetition stress test each iteration once the TG target is met, and `BenchmarkService` folds a graded distinct-trigram "repetition health" factor into QualityScore so near-loops are visible before the binary loop detector fires.

## Known Gotchas

- Always read `LlamaServerService.LastEffectiveSettings` after a start attempt rather than assuming the requested `LlamaSettings` took effect — self-healing retries silently revert unsupported values.
- Adding a new tunable parameter requires three coordinated edits: `LlamaSettings` (property + `ToServerArgs`/`Fingerprint`/`Summary`), `RecommendationService.ExplorationOrder` (heuristic order), and wherever the LLM-recommendation JSON schema/prompt enumerates valid parameter names — missing one causes the optimizer to silently never explore the new parameter via one of the two recommendation paths.
- `OptimizationProfile.ScoreResult()` weights differ significantly between Chat and Agentic — a change to scoring normalization (`NormalizeRate`/`NormalizeTtft` bounds) affects both profiles; check both when tuning scoring behavior. `NormalizeRate` is log-scale (TG 5–300, PP 50–10000) specifically so fast hardware doesn't saturate every config to 1.0 and fake "no improvement" convergence.
- `TimeToFirstTokenMs` is the **server-reported prompt-eval time** (`timings.prompt_ms`), not wall clock — the wall-clock tuple from `CompleteAsync` covers the entire non-streaming response and must not be used as TTFT (it double-counts generation speed).
- The MoE expert-count override must use the arch-prefixed GGUF key: `--override-kv {arch}.expert_used_count=int:N`, with `{arch}` read via `GgufMetadata.GetArchitecture()` (e.g. `qwen3moe`). Wrong/unprefixed keys are silently ignored by llama-server — verify in the startup log (`n_expert_used = N`).
- Thinking mode cannot be toggled via `--override-kv` (it's a chat-template variable, not GGUF metadata). Use `--chat-template-kwargs {"enable_thinking":...}` and, when disabling, also `--reasoning-budget 0`.
